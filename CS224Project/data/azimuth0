Azimuth is a term used in navigation and astronomy to denote the angular distance of a point on the horizon from a reference point. It is measured in degrees and is typically expressed in a clockwise direction from the reference point, with north being 0° and east being 90°. Azimuth is an important concept in astronomy, as it is used to calculate the position of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies.

In navigation, azimuth is used to calculate the direction of travel for a ship or aircraft. It is typically measured in degrees and expressed in a clockwise direction from north, with north being 0° and east being 90°. This measurement is used to determine the heading of a vessel or aircraft, and is also used to calculate the distance between two points.

In astronomy, azimuth is used to calculate the position of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies. It is typically expressed in degrees and is measured from the horizon in a clockwise direction, with north being 0° and east being 90°. This measurement is used to determine the location of a celestial body in the sky, and is also used to calculate the distance between two points in the sky.

Azimuth is also used to calculate the time of sunrise and sunset. The azimuth of the sun is the angle between the horizon and the center of the sun, measured in degrees and expressed in a clockwise direction from north. This measurement is used to determine the time of sunrise and sunset, as well as the length of the day and night.
