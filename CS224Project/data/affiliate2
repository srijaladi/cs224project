Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing in which a business rewards one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought about by the affiliate's own marketing efforts. It is a modern variation of the practice of paying finder's fees for the introduction of new clients to a business. Affiliate marketing can be a powerful tool for businesses of all sizes, and it can be especially beneficial for small businesses that are just starting out.

The most common form of affiliate marketing involves the use of banners, text links, and other forms of online advertising. Affiliates earn a commission when a customer clicks on the link or banner and completes a purchase. This type of marketing is often referred to as “pay-per-click” or “PPC” marketing.

By offering affiliates incentives such as discounts, free products, or other rewards, businesses can encourage affiliates to promote their products and services.
