Blackfish is a 2013 documentary film directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite that follows the story of Tilikum, an orca (killer whale) who has been in captivity for over 25 years. The film focuses on the captivity of orcas in marine parks and the consequences of keeping them in captivity. It also examines the consequences of captivity on the orcas, their trainers, and their families.

The film begins with the story of Tilikum, who was captured off the coast of Iceland in 1983. He was only two years old when he was taken from his family and brought to SeaWorld Orlando. Tilikum was used for breeding and was involved in the deaths of three people, including SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010. The film explores the circumstances surrounding these deaths and the consequences of keeping orcas in captivity.

The film interviews former SeaWorld trainers and marine biologists who discuss the physical and psychological effects of captivity on orcas. They discuss how orcas in captivity often suffer from stress, depression, and aggression due to inadequate space and lack of stimulation. They also discuss how orcas in the wild are much more active and social than those in captivity, and how captivity affects their natural behaviors.

The film also examines the consequences of captivity on the trainers and their families. It explores the emotional toll that working with captive orcas takes on trainers, and the guilt and grief they feel when orcas die in captivity. The film also looks at the legal and financial consequences of keeping orcas in captivity, as well as the public's perception of orcas in captivity.

The film has been credited with raising public awareness about the plight of captive orcas and the consequences of keeping them in captivity. It has sparked a national debate about the ethics of keeping orcas in captivity and has led to the closure of many marine parks that kept orcas in captivity.

Blackfish is a powerful and important film that sheds light on the consequences of keeping orcas in captivity. It is a must-see for anyone interested in animal welfare or the consequences of keeping animals in captivity. It is a powerful reminder of the importance of respecting animals and their right to live in their natural habitats.
