An astrolabe is an ancient astronomical instrument used for measuring the altitude of stars, the positions of the sun and moon, and other celestial bodies. It was used by astronomers, navigators, and astrologers from the classical period until the early modern period. It was one of the most important instruments used in astronomy and navigation before the invention of the telescope.

The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic period, around 150 BCE. It was a combination of two existing instruments, the armillary sphere and the dioptra. The armillary sphere was a spherical model of the celestial sphere, used for measuring the positions of stars and planets. The dioptra was a simple sighting instrument used for measuring angles. The astrolabe combined these two instruments, allowing for more accurate measurements of the positions of stars and planets.

The astrolabe consists of a flat disc, usually made of metal or wood, with a rotating arm or alidade. The disc is marked with a series of concentric circles, representing the celestial sphere. These circles are divided into degrees and minutes, allowing for precise measurements of angles.

The astrolabe has many uses. It can be used to measure the altitude of stars and planets, as well as the time of day or night. It can also be used to determine latitude and longitude, and to calculate the time of sunrise and sunset.

Astrolabes were used by astronomers in the classical period to make observations of the stars and planets. They were used by navigators in the early modern period to determine their position at sea. They were also used by astrologers to make predictions about the future.

The astrolabe has been used for centuries and has been an important tool in the fields of astronomy, navigation, and astrology. It is a fascinating instrument that has helped to shape our understanding of the universe.
