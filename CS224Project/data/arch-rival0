Arch-rivalry is a term used to describe a long-standing, intense, and often bitter rivalry between two or more entities. These rivalries are often characterized by a deep-seated animosity between the two parties and can often be traced back to a single event or series of events that occurred in the past. Arch-rivalries can be found in a variety of contexts, including sports, politics, business, and even relationships.

In sports, arch-rivalries are often based on geographical proximity or a history of competition between two teams or athletes. The most famous example of this is the rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, which dates back to the early 1900s. This rivalry has been fueled by the teams' respective successes and failures, as well as a series of iconic moments that have become part of baseball lore. Other examples of arch-rivalries in sports include the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics in the NBA, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL, and the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs in the NHL.

In politics, arch-rivalries often arise from ideological differences between two political parties or leaders. This can be seen in the rivalry between the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States, which has been ongoing since the founding of the nation. Other examples of arch-rivalries in politics include the rivalry between President Donald Trump and his predecessor, President Barack Obama, as well as the rivalry between the United Kingdom's Conservative and Labour parties.

In business, arch-rivalries often arise from competition between two companies in the same industry. A prime example of this is the rivalry between Apple and Microsoft, which has been ongoing since the 1980s. Other examples of arch-rivalries in business include the rivalry between Coca-Cola and Pepsi, the rivalry between Amazon and Walmart, and the rivalry between McDonald's and Burger King.

Finally, arch-rivalries can even be found in relationships. This can be seen in the rivalry between siblings, which is often characterized by a deep-seated animosity between the two parties. Other examples of arch-rivalries in relationships include the rivalry between former lovers, the rivalry between friends, and even the rivalry between parents and their children.

No matter what context it is found in, arch-rivalry is a powerful force that can drive people to do remarkable things. It can also be destructive, as it can lead to intense animosity and even violence. As such, it is important to recognize the power of arch-rivalry and to use it in a positive way.
