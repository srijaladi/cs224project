Anatomy is the branch of science that studies the structure of the human body and its organs. It is a complex and fascinating field of study that has been around for centuries. Anatomy is the foundation of medicine and has been used to diagnose and treat a variety of medical conditions.

The human body is made up of many different parts and systems. The skeletal system is made up of bones, ligaments, and tendons that provide structure and support for the body. The muscular system is made up of muscles that allow us to move and perform various tasks.
