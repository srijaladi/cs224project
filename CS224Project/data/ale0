Ale is a type of beer that has been around for centuries and is one of the oldest and most popular alcoholic beverages in the world. It is brewed from malted barley and other grains, such as wheat, rye, oats, and maize. Ale is fermented with top-fermenting yeast, which gives it a unique flavor and aroma, as well as a higher alcohol content than lagers.

In addition to the variety of styles, ale can also be flavored with a variety of ingredients. Common ingredients used to flavor ale include hops, herbs, spices, fruits, and even chocolate. These ingredients can be added during the brewing process or after fermentation to give the beer a unique flavor and aroma.
