An armrest is a type of support used to provide comfort and stability to the arms of a person sitting in a chair. They are commonly found on office chairs, sofas, and other types of seating. Armrests provide a place to rest oneâ€™s arms, as well as a place to lean on when sitting down.

The history of armrests goes back centuries. In ancient Greece and Rome, armrests were carved out of marble and were used to provide extra comfort to people seated in chairs. In the Middle Ages, armrests were made of wood, and were often covered in fabric. During the Renaissance, armrests were made of metal, and were often decorated with intricate designs.

Armrests have evolved over time, and today they are available in a variety of materials, shapes, and sizes. Common materials used to make armrests include wood, metal, plastic, and fabric. Armrests can be attached to the chair, or they can be removable. Some armrests are adjustable, allowing the user to adjust the height and angle of the armrest.
