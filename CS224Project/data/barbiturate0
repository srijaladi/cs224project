Barbiturates, also known as “downers”, are a type of drug used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and seizures. They are also used in anesthesiology to induce sleep before surgery. Barbiturates are classified as central nervous system (CNS) depressants, meaning they slow down the activity of the brain and the body.

Barbiturates are derivatives of barbituric acid, which was first synthesized in 1864. They were first used as sleeping pills in the early 1900s, and by the 1950s, they had become the most commonly prescribed sedative-hypnotic drugs in the United States.

Barbiturates can be taken orally, intravenously, or rectally. They are usually taken in pill form, but they can also be dissolved in liquid or injected. The effects of barbiturates depend on the dose and the individual. In low doses, they can cause relaxation, drowsiness, and mild euphoria. In higher doses, they can cause confusion, impaired judgment, and slurred speech.

In addition to their medical uses, barbiturates have a high potential for abuse and addiction. Barbiturate abuse can lead to serious health problems, including respiratory depression, coma, and even death. Withdrawal from barbiturates can be extremely dangerous and should be done under medical supervision.

Because of the dangers associated with barbiturate abuse, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has classified them as Schedule II drugs, meaning they have a high potential for abuse and addiction. The sale, distribution, and possession of barbiturates without a valid prescription are strictly prohibited.

Barbiturates are still used in some medical settings, but they have been largely replaced by other, safer drugs. If you or someone you know is using barbiturates, it is important to seek help from a medical professional.
