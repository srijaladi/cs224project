Arrival is a 2016 science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Eric Heisserer. The film stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest Whitaker, and follows a linguist who is recruited by the United States Army to interpret the language of aliens who have arrived on Earth.

The film opens with Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a professor of linguistics, mourning the death of her daughter. As she grieves, twelve mysterious spacecrafts arrive at various locations around the world. Louise is recruited by the United States Army to help interpret the language of the aliens. She is teamed up with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) and they travel to Montana, where one of the spacecrafts has landed.

At the site, Louise and Ian meet Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker), who is in charge of the mission. The aliens, referred to as “heptapods” due to their seven-limbed appearance, are unresponsive to human attempts to communicate. Louise begins to make progress when she discovers that the heptapods communicate through a written language of circular symbols. She gradually learns to understand the heptapod language and is able to establish a dialogue with them.

Louise and Ian eventually learn that the heptapods are visiting Earth to offer a gift to humanity. The gift is a form of advanced knowledge, which can be used to help humanity solve its problems.
