The film follows Jess, a young woman of Indian descent living in London with her traditional family. She is passionate about football and dreams of playing professionally, but her parents do not approve of her playing, as it is seen as inappropriate for a girl of her background. Despite this, Jess joins a local women’s team, coached by Joe, an Irishman. As the team progresses, Jess’s family discovers her secret and disapproves.
