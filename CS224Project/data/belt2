A belt is a flexible band or strap, typically made of leather or heavy cloth and worn around the waist, that is usually of less circumference than the hips underneath. Belts are used to secure or hold up clothing, like trousers or other articles of clothing, in a manner similar to suspenders and garters. Belts can also be decorative, made of a variety of materials and colors, and can be embellished with buckles, studs, and other decorations.

Belts have been used since antiquity as a way to secure clothing and have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs, where they were made of leather and metal. Belts were also used in ancient Greece, Rome, and China, and were often used to carry weapons and tools. In the Middle Ages, belts became popular as a way to keep clothing in place and were often decorated with metal buckles and other decorations.

Today, belts are used primarily as a fashion accessory. They are often made of leather, cloth, or synthetic materials and come in a variety of colors, styles, and designs. Belts can be used to accessorize an outfit, to hold up clothing, or to make a statement. They are also used as a symbol of power, authority, and status.

Belts come in a variety of widths and lengths, and can be worn on the waist, hips, or lower torso. The most common type of belt is a belt buckle, which is a metal or plastic buckle that is attached to the belt and secures it in place. Belts can also be secured with a clasp, a hook and eye, or a belt loop.

When wearing a belt, it is important to make sure that it fits properly. Belts should be snug but not too tight, and should not be so loose that they slip off. It is also important to make sure that the belt is the right length and width for the wearer.

Belts can be a great way to accessorize an outfit and make a statement. They can also be used to hold up clothing or to make a statement of power and authority. Belts are a timeless fashion accessory that can be worn for both formal and casual occasions.
