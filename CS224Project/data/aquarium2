An aquarium is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which aquatic plants or animals are kept and displayed. Aquariums are also known as fish tanks or simply tanks, and range in size from a small bowl large enough for only a few litres of water and a small number of fish, to immense public aquaria that can contain entire ecosystems. A large aquarium may have a built-in filtration system and lighting equipment and may be situated in a dedicated room.

Aquariums can be fresh or salt water and can serve as a home for both fish and invertebrates. Aquariums are often decorated with gravel, rocks, plants, and other decorations to create an aesthetically pleasing environment. Many aquariums also contain filtration systems to keep the water clean and provide oxygen for the inhabitants.

Aquariums are a great way to bring the beauty of the underwater world into the home. They can be a source of relaxation, a place to learn, and a way to bring nature into the home. Aquariums come in all shapes and sizes, and can be as simple or as complex as desired.

Setting up an aquarium can be a fun and rewarding experience. It is important to research the type of fish, plants, and other inhabitants that will be housed in the aquarium. This will help determine the size, shape, and type of aquarium that should be used. It is also important to consider the type of filtration system and lighting that will be needed to keep the aquarium inhabitants healthy.

Once the aquarium is set up, it is important to keep it clean and properly maintained. Regular water changes, filter maintenance, and monitoring of water chemistry are all important aspects of aquarium maintenance. It is also important to provide proper nutrition and care for the inhabitants.

Aquariums are a great way to bring a piece of the underwater world into the home. They can be a source of relaxation, a way to learn about aquatic life, and a way to bring nature into the home. With the proper research, setup, and maintenance, an aquarium can be a great addition to any home.
