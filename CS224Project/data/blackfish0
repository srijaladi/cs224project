The documentary begins with the death of Dawn Brancheau, a SeaWorld trainer who was killed by Tilikum in 2010. The film then goes back in time to explore Tilikum’s past, from his capture in the wild in 1983 to his life in captivity.

The film follows the story of several former SeaWorld trainers who speak out against the company’s practices and the dangers of working with captive orcas.

The film paints a bleak picture of the life of captive orcas. It shows the physical and psychological damage that captivity can cause, as well as the stress that the whales are under due to living in small tanks and performing unnatural behaviors for the entertainment of humans. The film also highlights the dangers of working with these animals, as demonstrated by the deaths of Tilikum’s trainers.
