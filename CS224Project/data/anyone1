My essay will be about my mother, who has been a major influence in my life since I was born. She has been a constant source of support and guidance, and I owe a lot of who I am today to her.

My mother was born in a small village in India. Growing up, she was raised by her parents and grandparents, who instilled in her a strong sense of family, faith, and hard work. Despite the poverty she faced and the lack of educational opportunities, she was determined to make something of her life. She worked hard in school and eventually earned a scholarship to attend a university in the United States.

Once she arrived in the U.S., she worked even harder to make a better life for herself and her family. She earned her degree in engineering and eventually landed a job in the field. She also worked hard to learn English and to make friends in her new home.

My mother has always been a role model for me. From a young age, she taught me the value of hard work and perseverance. She taught me to be kind, to be generous, and to always strive to do my best. She encouraged me to pursue my dreams and to never give up.

My mother is also a great listener. Whenever I have a problem or just need someone to talk to, she is always there for me. She always takes the time to listen and offer advice and support. She has also been a great source of comfort when Iâ€™ve gone through difficult times.

My mother is a remarkable woman who has overcome many obstacles in her life. She has shown me that anything is possible if you work hard and never give up. I am so thankful for all that she has done for me and for the example she has set. She is an incredible example of what it means to be a strong, independent woman, and I am so proud to call her my mother.
