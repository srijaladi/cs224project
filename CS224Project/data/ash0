Ash is a type of tree that is native to many parts of the world, including North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a hardwood tree with a straight, strong trunk and a rounded crown. Ash trees are popular in landscaping because of their attractive bark and foliage.

Ash is a deciduous tree, meaning it loses its leaves in the fall and grows new leaves in the spring. The leaves of ash trees are compound, with five to nine leaflets. The leaves are usually green in the summer and yellow or brown in the fall. The bark of ash trees is smooth and gray when young, but becomes more deeply furrowed as the tree ages.

Ash trees produce a nut-like fruit called a samara, which is often referred to as a “helicopter seed” because of its shape. The samaras are usually a light brown color and contain a single seed.

Ash wood is strong and durable, making it a popular choice for furniture, flooring, and other woodworking projects. It is also used in the manufacture of baseball bats and other sporting equipment. Ash is known for its resistance to shock and its ability to bend without breaking.

Ash trees are also valued for their ability to improve air quality. They absorb pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. Ash trees also provide food and shelter for wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.

Overall, ash is a versatile and attractive tree that is popular in landscaping and woodworking projects. Its strong wood and ability to improve air quality make it a valuable addition to any landscape.
