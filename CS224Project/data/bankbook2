A bankbook is a record of a customer's account balance with a financial institution, usually a bank. It is also known as a passbook or a savings ledger. The customer is usually required to present the bankbook to the bank in order to make deposits or withdrawals from their account.

The use of bankbooks dates back to the 18th century, when banks began offering customers the convenience of having their own personal accounts. Customers could deposit money into their accounts and the bank would record the transactions in their bankbook. This allowed customers to keep track of their deposits and withdrawals, as well as their account balance.

Today, bankbooks are still widely used by customers to manage their finances. They provide a convenient way to keep track of deposits and withdrawals, as well as a record of all transactions. Bankbooks can also be used to make payments and transfer funds between accounts.

Bankbooks are also used by banks to store customer information and to calculate interest payments. Banks use the information in the bankbook to calculate the interest rate on a customer's account, as well as the amount of money they owe each month.
