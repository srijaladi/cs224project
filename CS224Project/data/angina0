Angina is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It is a symptom of coronary artery disease, a condition in which arteries that supply the heart with blood become narrowed or blocked due to a buildup of plaque. Angina is usually felt as a tight, squeezing pain in the chest, but it can also be felt in the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. It is often described as a feeling of pressure or heaviness. Angina can range from mild to severe and usually lasts for a few minutes.

The most common type of angina is called stable angina. This type of angina is usually triggered by physical activity or emotional stress and is relieved by rest or taking medication. Stable angina is usually a sign that the arteries are narrowing and that the heart is not receiving enough oxygen.

Unstable angina is a more serious condition and is often a sign of a heart attack. This type of angina does not follow a pattern and can occur at rest or with minimal exertion. It is often more severe than stable angina and lasts longer.

Angina is typically diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, and tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, stress test, or cardiac catheterization. Treatment for angina usually involves lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Medications, such as nitrates or beta-blockers, may also be prescribed to help reduce chest pain. In some cases, surgery may be recommended to open blocked arteries.

Angina is a serious condition and can be a warning sign of a heart attack. It is important to seek medical attention if you experience symptoms of angina. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, angina can be managed and the chances of a future heart attack can be reduced.
