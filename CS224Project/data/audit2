An audit is a systematic, independent, and documented process for obtaining evidence and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which audit criteria are fulfilled. Audits are conducted to ensure that organizations are operating in accordance with the established standards, regulations, and laws. Audits are conducted by external and internal auditors. External auditors are third-party professionals who are hired by the organization to provide an independent opinion on the financial statements of the organization. Internal auditors are employees of the organization who are tasked with ensuring that all internal processes and procedures are in compliance with the established standards.

The purpose of an audit is to provide an objective opinion on the accuracy and reliability of the financial statements of the organization. The audit opinion is based on the results of the audit process. The audit process involves the evaluation of the accounting records, the internal control systems, and the financial statements of the organization. The audit process also includes an evaluation of the organization’s compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
