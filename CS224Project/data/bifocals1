Bifocals are a type of corrective eyewear that have two distinct lenses. The lenses are divided into two sections, with the top portion containing a prescription for distance vision and the bottom portion containing a prescription for near vision. This type of eyeglass was invented by Benjamin Franklin in the late 1700s.

Bifocals are designed to help people with presbyopia, a condition in which the eye's lens becomes less flexible with age, making it difficult to focus on close objects. Bifocals are particularly useful for people who need to see both near and far away objects clearly. They are also beneficial to people who need to switch between near and far vision tasks frequently, such as those who work at a computer all day.

Bifocals come in a variety of styles and designs. The most common type of bifocal is the half-moon, which has a round segmented lens for near vision and a flat segmented lens for distance vision. Trifocals are another type of bifocal that have three segments, with one for near vision, one for far vision, and one for intermediate vision. Progressive lenses are also available, which have a gradual change in prescription from the top of the lens to the bottom, allowing the wearer to focus on objects at any distance without having to move their head.

The lenses in bifocals are made from a variety of materials, depending on the wearer's needs. Common lens materials include plastic, polycarbonate, and glass. The frames for bifocals are available in a wide range of colors and styles, including metal, plastic, and rimless.

Bifocals are typically prescribed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. A comprehensive eye exam is necessary to determine the correct prescription for the bifocals. The optometrist or ophthalmologist will also take into account the patient's lifestyle and occupation when choosing the best type of bifocals for them.

Bifocals are an effective way to correct presbyopia and provide clear vision at both near and far distances. They are available in a variety of styles and designs to suit different needs and preferences. With proper care, bifocals can last for many years.
