Bait is a type of lure used in fishing to attract fish. It is usually made of some type of food or other material that is attractive to fish, such as worms, insects, small crustaceans, or other fish. Bait is used to entice fish to strike a hook or lure, and can be used in both fresh and saltwater fishing.

Bait is often used to target specific species of fish. Different types of bait may be more attractive to certain species than others. For example, worms are often used to target bass and other panfish, while shrimp and squid are often used to target saltwater species like snapper and grouper. Live bait, such as minnows or crayfish, can also be used to target certain species.

Bait can be purchased at most fishing tackle stores and can range from live bait, such as worms or minnows, to artificial lures, such as spoons and spinners. Live bait can be kept alive in a bait bucket or livewell, while artificial lures can be stored in a tackle box. Anglers should choose the right bait for the species they are targeting, as well as the type of water they are fishing in.

When using bait, anglers should use the right size and type of hook. Hooks should be sharp and of the appropriate size for the bait being used. For example, smaller hooks are often used for smaller bait, such as worms, while larger hooks are used for larger bait, such as shrimp or squid. Anglers should also use the right amount of bait, as too much can be wasteful and too little can be ineffective.

When fishing with bait, anglers should be aware of local regulations regarding the use of bait. Some areas may have restrictions on the type of bait that can be used, as well as the size and number of hooks. It is important to follow these regulations to ensure that the fish population remains healthy and sustainable.

Overall, bait is a great way to target certain species of fish. Different types of bait can be used to target different species, and the right size and type of hook should be used to ensure a successful catch. Anglers should also be aware of local regulations regarding the use of bait, as these can help ensure the health of the fish population.
