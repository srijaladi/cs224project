Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity in order to provide access to a system or resource. Authentication is used to protect the security of the system or resource by ensuring that only authenticated users are allowed access. Authentication is a crucial component of any secure system, and is used to protect data, resources, and networks from unauthorized access.

Authentication is usually accomplished through a combination of methods, including passwords, biometrics, and tokens. Passwords are the most common form of authentication, and are used to verify the identity of a user by requiring them to enter a secret code. Biometrics are used to verify a user's identity by analyzing their physical characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. Tokens are used to provide secure access to a system by providing a unique code that must be entered by the user.

Authentication is used in a variety of contexts, including online banking, e-commerce, and other online services. In these contexts, authentication is used to protect the user's data, resources, and accounts from unauthorized access. Authentication is also used to protect physical resources, such as buildings, vehicles, and other assets.
