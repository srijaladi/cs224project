Blinkers, or blinkers, are a type of horse tack used to limit the range of vision of a horse. They are usually made of leather or plastic and are attached to the sides of a horse's bridle. They are used mainly in horse racing, but they can also be used in other equestrian sports.

Blinkers were first used in the early 19th century, when they were made of cloth and tied onto the bridle. They were designed to keep the horse focused on the track and to prevent it from being distracted by other horses or other objects in the environment. As time passed, the design of the blinkers improved, and they eventually became a standard piece of equipment in horse racing.

The purpose of blinkers is to limit the range of vision of a horse. By doing so, the horse is less likely to be distracted by other horses or objects in the environment, which can cause the horse to lose focus and potentially lead to an accident. Additionally, the blinkers can help the horse remain focused on the track, which can improve its performance.

While blinkers are most commonly used in horse racing, they can also be used in other equestrian sports, such as dressage, show jumping, and eventing. In dressage, the blinkers are used to help the horse focus on the rider and their aids. In show jumping, they are used to help the horse focus on the fences and jumps. In eventing, the blinkers can help the horse focus on the cross-country course.

When using blinkers, it is important to ensure that they are fitted correctly. If they are too loose, they can cause the horse to become distracted, and if they are too tight, they can cause discomfort. Additionally, the type of blinkers used should be appropriate for the horse and the type of activity that it is doing. For example, some types of blinkers are designed for racing, while others are designed for dressage or show jumping.

In conclusion, blinkers are an important piece of equipment used in horse racing and other equestrian sports. They are designed to limit the range of vision of a horse, which can help keep the horse focused on the track or activity. It is important to ensure that the blinkers are fitted correctly and are appropriate for the horse and the activity that it is doing. By doing so, the horse can remain focused and perform well.
