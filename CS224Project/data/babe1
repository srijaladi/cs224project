Babe Ruth is one of the most iconic figures in American sports history. He was a larger-than-life figure who transcended the game of baseball, becoming a cultural icon in the process. His career spanned from 1914 to 1935, and during that time, he set numerous records, including the most home runs in a single season and the most career home runs. He was also one of the first five players inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936.

Ruth was born George Herman Ruth Jr. on February 6, 1895 in Baltimore, Maryland. His parents, Kate Schamberger and George Herman Ruth Sr., were German immigrants. Ruth was the eldest of eight children, and his parents struggled to make ends meet. At the age of seven, Ruth was sent to St. Mary’s Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage. It was here that Ruth was first introduced to the game of baseball.

Ruth’s baseball career began in 1914, when he signed with the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. He was a pitcher and played in the minor leagues for two years before being sold to the Boston Red Sox in 1916. Ruth was an immediate success in Boston and quickly established himself as one of the best pitchers in the American League. He won 23 games in 1916 and 24 in 1917, and was an integral part of the Red Sox team that won the World Series in 1918.

In 1919, Ruth was sold to the New York Yankees, and it was here that his career took off. He was converted to an outfielder, and his batting prowess quickly made him a fan favorite. In 1920, Ruth set a single-season home run record with 54, and he would go on to break his own record four more times. He also led the Yankees to four World Series championships during his tenure with the team.

Ruth retired from baseball in 1935, and his career statistics are still impressive. He holds the record for most career home runs (714), and he is second in career runs batted in (2,213) and third in career batting average (.342). He was also a seven-time American League home run champion and a two-time American League RBI champion.

Babe Ruth's legacy has endured for more than a century. He was a larger-than-life figure who revolutionized the game of baseball and captivated the nation. He was a pioneer in the sport, setting numerous records and becoming the first player to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. His impact on the game and the culture of baseball is still felt today, and his legacy will continue to live on for generations to come.
