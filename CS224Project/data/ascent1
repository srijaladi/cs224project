The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World is a book written by Niall Ferguson, a British historian, and a professor of history at Harvard University. It was first published in 2008 and has since become a classic in the field of financial history.

The Ascent of Money traces the history of money and financial systems from ancient Mesopotamia to the present day. It examines the development of banking, insurance, stock markets, and other financial instruments, as well as their impact on the world economy. Ferguson argues that financial systems have been the driving force behind the rise of modern civilization, and that the current global financial crisis is a result of our failure to learn from the past.

The book is divided into seven parts. The first part, "The Origins of Money," examines the origins of money and the earliest financial systems.

The third part, "The Age of Paper Money," looks at the emergence of paper money and its role in the rise of modern capitalism. It examines the development of the modern stock market and the role of the Federal Reserve System in the United States.

The fourth part, "The Age of Risk," looks at the development of modern risk management and its role in the global economy. It examines the development of insurance, derivatives, and other forms of risk management, as well as their impact on the world economy.

The fifth part, "The Age of Credit," looks at the development of credit and its role in the world economy. It examines the development of consumer credit, mortgages, and other forms of credit, as well as their impact on the global economy.

The sixth part, "The Age of Globalization," looks at the development of global financial markets and their role in the world economy. It examines the development of foreign exchange markets, international capital markets, and other aspects of globalization.
