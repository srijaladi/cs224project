Beavers are one of the most iconic animals of North America. They are the largest rodents in North America, and they are known for their hard work in the wild. Beavers are found in a variety of habitats, including lakes, rivers, and wetlands.

Beavers are semi-aquatic rodents, meaning they spend time both in and out of the water. They have webbed feet, which help them to swim and to move around in the water. They also have thick fur, which helps them to stay warm and dry in cold weather. Beavers have large, flat tails that they use as a rudder when they swim.

Beavers are well-known for their hard work. They build dams and lodges out of sticks and mud. Beavers use their sharp front teeth to gnaw on trees and shrubs, which they then use to build their dams and lodges. These dams and lodges provide shelter for the beavers, and they also help to control the flow of water in the area.

Beavers are herbivores, meaning they eat mostly plants. They mainly eat the bark and twigs of trees, but they also eat grasses and other aquatic plants. Beavers also eat aquatic insects, fish, and frogs.

Beavers are social animals, living in family groups. They are monogamous, meaning they have one mate for life. They mate for life, and they remain loyal to their mate and their family. A beaver family consists of a pair of adults and their young.

Beavers are active during the day and night, but they are most active at night. They are also active in all seasons, and they are able to survive in cold climates. Beavers can live up to 24 years in the wild, and they can live up to 30 years in captivity.
