 pattern

The Adapter Pattern is a software design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. It is a structural pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. This pattern is used in situations where two existing classes have incompatible interfaces and cannot be used together without modification.

The Adapter Pattern is a way to bridge the gap between two incompatible interfaces. It is a structural pattern that allows the interface of one class to be used as the interface of another class. This pattern is used when two existing classes have incompatible interfaces and cannot be used together without modification.

The Adapter Pattern is used to convert the interface of one class into another interface that can be used by the other class. The adapter class acts as a bridge between the two classes by providing an interface that is compatible with both classes. The adapter class implements the interface of the class it is adapting and delegates the calls to the adapted class.

The Adapter Pattern is a useful pattern for creating reusable code. It can be used to make code more maintainable and extensible by allowing different classes to work together. This pattern can be used to make code more flexible and reduce the amount of code duplication.
