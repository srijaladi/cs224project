An antigen is a molecule or molecular structure that is capable of inducing an immune response in an organism. It is usually a foreign substance, such as a virus, bacteria, or other microorganism, that is recognized as non-self by the immune system. Antigens can be proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, or other molecules that are found on the surface of cells, viruses, and bacteria. The immune system recognizes antigens as foreign and produces antibodies to bind to and neutralize them.

Antigens can be divided into two main categories: exogenous and endogenous antigens. Exogenous antigens are those that originate outside of the body and are typically the target of an immune response. They can be found on the surface of viruses, bacteria, and other microorganisms, as well as on the surface of certain cells. Examples of exogenous antigens include bacterial toxins, viral proteins, and certain carbohydrates. Endogenous antigens, on the other hand, are those that originate within the body, such as self-antigens. Examples of endogenous antigens include proteins found on the surface of red blood cells, as well as certain proteins found in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).

The immune system is capable of recognizing and responding to antigens in a variety of ways. One of the most important functions of the immune system is to recognize and respond to foreign antigens. This is done through the process of antigen recognition. During antigen recognition, the immune system recognizes the antigen as foreign and triggers a response to eliminate it. This response can be either humoral or cellular.

Humoral immunity is the production of antibodies against an antigen. During humoral immunity, B cells produce antibodies that bind to and neutralize the antigen. Antibodies are proteins that are specific to a particular antigen and can recognize it even in small amounts.

Cellular immunity, on the other hand, is the activation of T cells against an antigen. During cellular immunity, T cells recognize the antigen and release cytokines, which are small molecules that stimulate the production of other cells that can attack and destroy the antigen.

The immune system is also capable of recognizing self-antigens, which are antigens that originate within the body. This process is known as self-tolerance, and it ensures that the body does not attack its own cells. Self-tolerance is maintained by a process known as clonal deletion, in which T cells that recognize self-antigens are destroyed.

In conclusion, antigens are molecules or molecular structures that are capable of inducing an immune response. They can be divided into two main categories: exogenous and endogenous antigens. The immune system is capable of recognizing and responding to antigens through the processes of antigen recognition, humoral immunity, and cellular immunity. In addition, the immune system is capable of recognizing self-antigens and maintaining self-tolerance through a process known as clonal deletion.
