Awards can be awarded for a variety of reasons, from academic achievement to athletic ability, or even for acts of bravery or heroism.

Awards are often associated with prestigious events such as the Academy Awards or the Nobel Prize, but awards are also given out in many other contexts.

Awards can also be given out based on a combination of both systems.
