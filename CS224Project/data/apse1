An apse is a semicircular or polygonal recess in a church, usually located at the east end, and often containing the altar. This feature is common in many churches, especially those in the Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic styles. The apse has a long and varied history, and is an important element of church architecture.

The earliest known apse is found in the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which dates back to the 6th century BC. This structure featured a semicircular recess at the east end, which was used to house the cult statue of the god. This design was later adopted by the early Christians, who used the apse to house the altar and the tabernacle.

During the Byzantine period, the apse became increasingly elaborate. In many churches, the apse was decorated with mosaics and frescoes, and the altar was often placed on a raised platform. The apse was also used to house the bishop’s throne, and was often surrounded by a semi-circular ambulatory.

In the Romanesque period, the apse was often used to house the choir, and was often larger and more elaborate than its Byzantine counterpart. The apse was often decorated with sculpted figures and elaborate architectural details. The altar was usually placed on a raised platform in the center of the apse, and was often surrounded by an ambulatory.

The Gothic period saw the apse reach its most elaborate form. The apse was often larger and more ornate than in previous periods, and was often decorated with intricate sculptures and stained glass windows. The altar was usually placed on a raised platform in the center of the apse, and was often surrounded by an ambulatory.

Today, the apse is still an important element of church architecture. It is often used to house the altar and the tabernacle, and is often decorated with mosaics, frescoes, and sculptures. The apse is also used to house the bishop’s throne, and is often surrounded by a semi-circular ambulatory.
