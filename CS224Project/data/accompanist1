An accompanist is an individual who plays a secondary musical instrument to support the main performer. They provide aural accompaniment and often serve as the backbone to a performance. Accompanists come in many different forms and can be found in a variety of musical genres, from classical to jazz to pop.

Accompanists are often overlooked in the music industry, but they are an integral part of any performance. They provide the foundation upon which the main performer is able to shine, without whom the performance would be incomplete. An accompanist can be a pianist, guitarist, or any other instrument that provides aural accompaniment. They are often found in musicals and theater performances, accompanying the singers and actors.

Accompanists have a unique role in the music industry. They are able to take the music of a composer and arrange it for their own instrument. This allows them to create their own unique interpretation of the piece and to add their own personal flair to the performance. Accompanists are also able to improvise and create their own musical ideas to add to the performance. This is especially important in jazz and other improvisational genres.

Accompanists also have the important task of keeping the performance on track. They are responsible for keeping the tempo and providing cues to the other musicians. This is especially important in classical music, where the accompanist is often responsible for setting the tempo and the dynamics of the piece.

In addition to providing aural accompaniment, accompanists can also provide a visual element to a performance. They can be used to add texture and depth to a performance by playing a secondary instrument in the background. This can be especially effective in classical music, where the accompanist can provide a visual counterpoint to the main performer.
