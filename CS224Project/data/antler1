Antlers are an important part of the deer family’s biology, and have been studied extensively by biologists and other scientists.

Antlers are a unique feature of the deer family, and are composed of bone, cartilage, and a type of connective tissue called “fibrous tissue”. They are typically found on males, although females of some species, such as the reindeer, may also have them. The size and shape of antlers vary greatly between species, and also between individuals of the same species. Antlers are typically shed and regrown each year, and their growth is regulated by hormones and other biological factors.

Antlers are believed to play an important role in the deer family’s social structure. In some species, antlers are used for display and courtship, while in other species they are used for combat and defense. Antlers are also believed to be important for species recognition, and may help to distinguish between individuals of the same species.
