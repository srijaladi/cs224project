An associate degree is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study intended to usually last two years or more. This type of degree is most commonly awarded in the fields of applied sciences, business, and the liberal arts.

An associate degree is a great way for students to get an introduction to a field of study and gain a basic understanding of its principles. It is also a great way for students to explore a particular career field and determine if it is the right choice for them.

The curriculum for an associate degree typically includes general education classes, as well as classes in the major field of study. The classes taken in the major field of study will vary depending on the school and the program. Generally, students will take classes in math, science, English, and other liberal arts areas. In addition, students may take classes in the field of their major, such as accounting, marketing, or computer science.

The most common benefit of an associate degree is the ability to transfer credits to a four-year college or university. Many schools have agreements with other institutions that allow students to transfer their credits and continue their education at a four-year institution.

Having an associate degree can also help students to stand out in the job market, as they will have a better understanding of the field they are entering.
