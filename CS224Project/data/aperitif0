Aperitifs have been around since the 18th century, and have been enjoyed by people all over the world. They are often served with a variety of snacks such as olives, nuts, and cheese. Aperitifs can be enjoyed on their own, or they can be combined with other drinks to create a delicious and sophisticated cocktail.

Aperitifs are usually made with a base of dry white or sparkling wine. Other ingredients such as herbs, spices, and fruit juices are then added to create a unique flavor. Popular aperitifs include Aperol, Campari, and Pimm's. These drinks are typically served with ice and a slice of citrus fruit.

Aperitifs are a great way to start a meal, and can help to set the tone for the evening. They can be enjoyed before a meal to stimulate the appetite, or after a meal to aid in digestion. They are also a popular choice for social occasions, such as dinner parties and happy hours.

When choosing an aperitif, it is important to consider the type of meal that will be served. Light, dry aperitifs are best suited for lighter meals, while more robust aperitifs are better for heavier meals.
