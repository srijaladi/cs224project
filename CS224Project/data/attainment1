It is a process that involves setting goals, developing plans to achieve those goals, taking action, and monitoring progress.

The final step in the attainment process is monitoring progress. This involves regularly evaluating progress towards the goal and making adjustments as necessary. This will help to ensure that the goal is reached in the most efficient and effective way possible.
