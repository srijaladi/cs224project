Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese medicine that dates back more than 2,500 years. It is based on the belief that an energy force, known as qi (pronounced “chee”), flows through the body along pathways called meridians. According to this belief, illness or pain is caused by an imbalance or disruption in the flow of qi. Acupuncture is used to restore the balance of qi, and thus promote healing.

Acupuncture involves the insertion of very thin needles into specific points on the body. These points are located along the pathways of the meridians. It is believed that the needles stimulate the flow of qi, and thus help to restore balance to the body.

The practice of acupuncture has been used to treat a wide variety of medical conditions, including pain, digestive problems, headaches, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. It is also used to help people quit smoking and lose weight.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes acupuncture as a safe and effective treatment for a wide range of conditions, including nausea, vomiting, low back pain, neck pain, knee pain, and migraine headaches. In addition, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has concluded that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of certain conditions, including migraine headaches, tension headaches, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, and low back pain.

In the United States, acupuncture is typically performed by a licensed acupuncturist. The acupuncturist will first take a medical history and then perform a physical exam. He or she will then decide on the best course of treatment, which may include acupuncture, herbal remedies, or other forms of traditional Chinese medicine.

The needles used in acupuncture are very thin and usually cause very little discomfort. The needles are usually left in place for 15 to 20 minutes. During the treatment, the acupuncturist may move the needles or apply heat or pressure to the needles.

Acupuncture is generally considered to be a safe and effective treatment for many conditions. However, it is important to note that it should not be used as a substitute for conventional medical care. If you are considering acupuncture, it is important to discuss it with your doctor to make sure it is appropriate for you.
