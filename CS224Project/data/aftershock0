An aftershock is a smaller earthquake that occurs after a larger earthquake, in the same area of the main shock. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced fault plane adjusts to the effects of the main shock. Generally, aftershocks are found up to one-tenth the magnitude of the main shock. They can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the main shock has occurred.

Aftershocks can cause further damage to already weakened structures, disrupt rescue and relief operations, and lead to further loss of life and property. They also cause psychological trauma, as people are reminded of the event and its consequences.

The physical effects of an aftershock depend on its magnitude, the region it occurs in, and the geology of the area. The most common effects are ground shaking, landslides, liquefaction, and tsunamis. Ground shaking is the most common effect of an aftershock and can cause further damage to buildings and infrastructure. Landslides are caused by the shaking of the ground, which can cause soil and rocks to move down slopes. Liquefaction occurs when the shaking of the ground causes water-saturated soil to become unstable, leading to the formation of sand boils or sand volcanoes. Tsunamis are caused by large earthquakes, and aftershocks can trigger additional tsunamis.

Aftershocks can be predicted to some degree, based on the magnitude of the main shock and the region it occurs in. However, the exact timing and magnitude of aftershocks cannot be predicted with certainty. Scientists use a variety of techniques to study aftershocks, such as seismology, geology, and geodesy.

The best way to protect yourself from an aftershock is to be prepared. Make sure you have a plan for what to do in the event of an earthquake, including a safe place to go and items to take with you. Make sure you know the warning signs of an aftershock, such as shaking or rumbling, and be prepared to take action if you notice these signs. Make sure you have a disaster kit with supplies such as food, water, and a first aid kit. Finally, stay informed about the latest aftershock activity in your area.
