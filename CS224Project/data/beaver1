Beavers are one of the most iconic and beloved animals in the world. They are known for their large, flat tails, and their ability to build dams and lodges. They are found in many parts of the world and are a keystone species, meaning they have a major impact on their environment.

Beavers are rodents, and the largest in the world. They range in size from 30 to 70 pounds and can be up to four feet long. They have thick, brown fur and webbed hind feet. Their most recognizable feature is their large, flat tail. This tail is used for balance, swimming, and warning other beavers of danger.

Beavers are primarily nocturnal, meaning they are active at night. During the day, they rest and groom in their lodges. They are social animals and live in groups of up to 12 individuals. They are monogamous, meaning they mate for life and raise their young together.

Beavers are known for their engineering skills. They build dams and lodges out of sticks, mud, and stones. These dams help to regulate the flow of water in their environment and create wetlands. These wetlands are important habitats for many species of birds, fish, amphibians, and other animals.

Beavers also help to reduce flooding and erosion. By creating wetlands, they slow the flow of water and absorb excess water. This helps to prevent flooding and erosion in downstream areas.

Beavers also help to improve water quality. The wetlands they create act as natural filters, trapping sediment, pollutants, and other contaminants. This helps to keep water clean and healthy for wildlife and humans.

Beavers are an important part of the environment. They help to regulate water flow, reduce flooding and erosion, and improve water quality. They are a keystone species and their presence is essential to the health of their environment.
