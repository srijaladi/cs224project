Armor is a type of protective equipment used to protect the body from physical harm. It has been used throughout history by many different cultures and civilizations and is still used today in some military and law enforcement applications. Armor is typically made from metal, leather, or other materials and can range from simple cloth to complex plate armor.

Armor has been used since the dawn of time, with the earliest examples dating back to the Bronze Age. During this time, armor was made from leather, wood, or other materials and was used to protect the wearer from weapons such as swords, spears, and arrows. As time progressed, armor became more advanced and began to include metal plates and mail. This type of armor was used in the Middle Ages by knights and other warriors.

Armor was also used in the ancient world. In ancient Greece, armor was typically made from bronze and was used to protect soldiers in battle. In ancient Rome, armor was made from iron and was used to protect the wearer from weapons such as swords and spears.

The use of armor has continued into modern times. Today, armor is used by many militaries and law enforcement agencies to protect personnel from bullets and other projectiles. Armor is also used in some sports, such as paintball, to protect players from impact.

There are many different types of armor. Body armor is typically made from Kevlar or other materials and is designed to protect the wearer from bullets and other projectiles. Plate armor is made from metal plates and is designed to protect the wearer from swords and other weapons. Ballistic armor is designed to protect the wearer from bullets and other projectiles.

Armor has evolved over the centuries to become lighter, stronger, and more protective. Modern armor is made from materials such as Kevlar and is designed to be lightweight and comfortable while still providing protection from bullets and other projectiles.
