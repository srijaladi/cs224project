Passwords are the most common form of authentication, as they are easy to use and can be used to restrict access to certain resources or information. Tokens are also used in authorisation, as they are more secure than passwords and can be used to restrict access to specific resources or information. Other forms of authentication such as biometric authentication, two-factor authentication, and single sign-on may also be used in authorisation.
