An archive is a collection of documents and other records that have been collected and stored for future reference and research. Archives are essential for preserving the history of our society and are used to document the past and present.

Archives can include a variety of materials such as manuscripts, photographs, audio recordings, films, and even digital records.

They can also be used to store personal items such as letters, diaries, and artwork.

Archives are often organized in a variety of ways. Some archives are organized by date, while others are organized by subject or topic. Many archives also contain information about the people who created the documents and records, such as their names, dates of birth and death, and other biographical information.
