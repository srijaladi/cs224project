An aside is a dramatic device in which a character speaks to the audience or another character without other characters in the scene being aware of the conversation. It is often used to provide insight into the character’s thoughts and feelings, or to provide additional information to the audience. Asides are a common feature of plays, films, and television shows, and can be used to great effect to add depth and complexity to a story.

The use of asides has been traced back to Ancient Greek theatre, where it was used to provide commentary on the action of the play. Aristotle’s Poetics states that “the characters should not speak to each other what is obvious to the audience.” In other words, characters should not explain what the audience already knows, but instead, should use asides to provide additional information and insight.

Asides can be used to provide a variety of different types of information. They can be used to provide background information, to provide additional context, or to provide a character’s inner thoughts and feelings. Asides can also be used to provide comic relief, or to provide a contrast between what a character is saying to the other characters in the scene, and what they are thinking or feeling.

Asides can also be used to provide a sense of intimacy between the audience and the character. By providing a character’s inner thoughts and feelings, the audience is able to gain a deeper understanding of the character and their motivations. This can be particularly effective when used to provide an insight into a character’s inner struggle.

When used effectively, asides can be a powerful tool for creating a deeper connection between the audience and the characters. However, it is important to remember that asides should not be used too often, as they can quickly become distracting and take away from the story. Asides should also be used sparingly, as too many asides can make a scene feel overlong and drawn out.

Overall, asides are a valuable tool for adding depth and complexity to a story. By providing additional information and insight into a character’s thoughts and feelings, asides can help to create a deeper connection between the audience and the characters. Asides should be used sparingly, however, as too many asides can quickly become distracting and take away from the story.
