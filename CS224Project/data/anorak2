An anorak is a type of jacket that is typically made of waterproof fabric, such as nylon, and it is often lined with fleece or fur. It is commonly used by people who enjoy outdoor activities, such as skiing, snowboarding, and hiking, as it is designed to keep the wearer warm and dry in inclement weather. The anorak has been around for centuries, first appearing in the Arctic regions of northern Europe and North America. In recent years, the anorak has become a popular fashion item, with many different styles and designs available.

Anoraks are typically hooded and feature a drawstring closure at the neck. The hood can be adjusted to fit tightly around the head, providing additional warmth and protection from the elements. The length of an anorak can vary, with some reaching down to the mid-thigh or even to the ankles. The anorak is also designed to be lightweight, making it easy to carry and store when not in use.

Anoraks are ideal for cold weather activities, as they are designed to keep the wearer warm and dry. The waterproof fabric helps to keep out moisture and wind, while the insulation helps to trap body heat. The hood helps to protect the face from the elements, and the drawstring closure can be adjusted to fit the head tightly. Anoraks are also great for layering, as they can be worn over other clothing items to provide extra warmth.

Anoraks are available in a variety of styles and designs, ranging from traditional to modern. Traditional anoraks are usually made of heavy-duty fabrics, such as wool, and feature a fur-lined hood. Modern anoraks, on the other hand, are often made of lightweight materials, such as nylon, and may feature a drawstring waist and adjustable cuffs. There are also anoraks designed specifically for different activities, such as skiing and snowboarding.
