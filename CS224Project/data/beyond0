Beyond Meat has created a variety of products that are designed to replicate the taste, texture, and nutrition of traditional animal-based meat.

It contains 20g of plant-based protein and is made without GMOs, soy, or gluten. Other products include the Beyond Sausage, Beyond Chicken Strips, and Beyond Beef Crumbles. All of these products are designed to have the same taste and texture as their animal-based counterparts, but are much healthier and more sustainable.

Beyond Meat’s products are cholesterol-free and contain no antibiotics, hormones, or artificial ingredients. They are also high in protein and fiber, and low in saturated fat and calories. Additionally, Beyond Meat’s products are much more sustainable than traditional animal-based meat. They require significantly less land, water, and energy to produce than animal-based products and generate fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

Beyond Meat’s products are also incredibly versatile. They can be used in a variety of recipes, from burgers and tacos to stir-frys and salads. They can also be used as a substitute for traditional animal-based meat in any dish.
