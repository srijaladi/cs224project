Depending on the specialty you choose, you may also need to take additional exams or complete a fellowship program.

Once you have completed your residency, you can become a licensed doctor and practice medicine. As a doctor, you will be responsible for diagnosing and treating patients, ordering tests and procedures, and providing advice and education. You will also be responsible for keeping up to date with the latest medical advancements and treatments.
