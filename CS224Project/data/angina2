Angina is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It is a symptom of coronary artery disease, which is the narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Angina is often described as a squeezing, pressure, or tightness in the chest, and it can also spread to the arms, neck, jaw, or back. It can range from mild to severe and can last for a few minutes or longer.

The most common type of angina is stable angina, which is usually caused by physical exertion or stress. It is usually relieved by rest or medication. Unstable angina is less common and is usually caused by a sudden blockage of the coronary arteries, which can lead to a heart attack.

The primary goal of treatment for angina is to reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke. This is usually done by reducing the workload of the heart and improving blood flow to the coronary arteries. Treatment may include lifestyle modifications such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet, as well as medications such as aspirin and nitroglycerin. In some cases, angioplasty or bypass surgery may be needed to open blocked arteries.

It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of angina and seek medical attention right away if they occur. The earlier the diagnosis is made, the more effective the treatment will be. It is also important to follow the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor to reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

Angina is a serious condition that can be life-threatening. It is important to take steps to reduce your risk of developing angina, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and being aware of the signs and symptoms. If you experience any of the symptoms of angina, it is important to seek medical attention right away. Early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke.
