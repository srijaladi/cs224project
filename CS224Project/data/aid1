ilfitri

Eid al-Fitr, also known as the "Festival of Breaking the Fast", is an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting. The holiday celebrates the conclusion of the 29 or 30 days of dawn-to-sunset fasting during the entire month of Ramadan. The day of Eid, therefore, falls on the first day of the month of Shawwal. The date for the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on the observation of new moon by local religious authorities, so the exact day of celebration varies by locality.

Eid al-Fitr has a particular salat (Islamic prayer) consisting of two rakats (units) and generally offered in an open field or large hall. It may be performed only in congregation (jamāʿat) and has an additional extra six Takbirs (raising of the hands to the ears while saying "Allāhu ʾAkbar" which means "God is the greatest"), three of them in the beginning of the first raka'ah and three of them just before ruku' in the second raka'ah in the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam. Other Sunni schools usually have twelve Takbirs, seven in the first, and five at the beginning of the second raka'ah. This Eid al-Fitr salat is, depending on which juristic opinion is followed, fard (obligatory), mustahabb (strongly recommended, just short of obligatory) or mandoob (preferable).

On this day, Muslims wake up early in the morning and perform the Eid prayer, which consists of two rakats and is usually performed in an open field or hall. After the prayer, Muslims visit their relatives, friends and acquaintances or hold large communal celebrations in homes, community centers or rented halls. Gifts are exchanged, new clothes are worn and children receive gifts of money.

The most common greeting during this holiday is the Arabic greeting “Eid Mubarak”, which means “have a blessed Eid”. This is often accompanied by a formal embrace and three kisses on the cheek.

The day of Eid al-Fitr is a time of official receptions and visits. Government officials usually start the day by visiting the graves of martyrs and national heroes, then the president or king will address the nation, followed by visits to the homes of citizens and officials.

Eid al-Fitr is also a time of charity and giving to those in need. Muslims are encouraged to give Zakat al-Fitr (charity in the form of food) before the end of Ramadan. This charity is intended to help the poor and those in need and is usually given in the form of food, such as dates, rice, barley, wheat or other staples.

Eid al-Fitr is also a time for celebration and joy. Many families and communities organize feasts and parties, and children receive gifts of money, new clothes and toys. People also visit friends and relatives, and exchange greetings and gifts.

Eid al-Fitr is a joyous occasion that marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. It is a day of celebration, charity, and joy, and a time for Muslims to come together and celebrate their faith and their blessings.
