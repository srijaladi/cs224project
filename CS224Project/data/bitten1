Bitten is a supernatural drama television series that was created by Daegan Fryklind and based on the Women of the Otherworld novels by Canadian author Kelley Armstrong. The series follows the story of Elena Michaels, the world’s only female werewolf, and her struggles to keep her werewolf identity a secret from the rest of the world. The series aired for three seasons on the Space channel in Canada and Syfy in the United States.

The series begins with Elena Michaels, a successful photographer living in Toronto, Canada. She is hiding a dark secret from the world: she is a werewolf. Elena was bitten by her former lover, Clay Danvers, and has been living with her werewolf identity for the past four years. She is trying to live a normal life and keep her werewolf identity a secret, but it’s not easy. When Clay, who has been living in exile in Europe, returns to Toronto, Elena’s life is thrown into turmoil. Clay is determined to make Elena rejoin the pack and take her rightful place as its leader. Elena is hesitant to join the pack, but soon finds herself drawn in by their world and the power that comes with it.

Elena is joined by her closest friends and allies: her best friend Paige Winterbourne, a witch; Jeremy Danvers, Clay’s adoptive father and the leader of the pack; and Nick Sorrentino, a human detective who is investigating the werewolf murders that are occurring in Toronto. As Elena is pulled deeper into the werewolf world, she discovers the truth about her past and the events that led to her becoming a werewolf. She also discovers the truth about Clay and their relationship.

Throughout the series, Elena and her allies battle against the forces of evil, including the powerful witch-hunter Malcolm Danvers and the mysterious cabal known as the Mutts. The series also explores the complicated relationships between all of the characters, as they struggle to come to terms with their supernatural identities and the secrets they keep from each other.

The series finale aired on April 25, 2015. The series was praised for its strong female characters, its exploration of complex relationships, and its unique take on the werewolf mythology. Bitten was a critical and commercial success, and has become a cult classic among fans of the supernatural genre.
