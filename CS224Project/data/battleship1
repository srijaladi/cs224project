Battleship is a classic game of naval warfare that has been enjoyed by generations of players. The game is played on a board with two players, each representing a fleet of ships. The goal of the game is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they can sink yours.

The game board is made up of a 10x10 grid, with each player's ships placed on the grid. The ships can be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each player has five ships, including a battleship, a cruiser, two destroyers, and a submarine. The battleship is the largest and most powerful ship, and it is the only ship that can attack other ships. The other ships can only defend against attacks.

The game begins with each player taking turns to guess the location of their opponent's ships. The players can only guess one square at a time, and they must mark each square they guess with an "X" or an "O". If they guess correctly, they mark the square with an "X" and their opponent must mark the square with an "O". If they guess incorrectly, they mark the square with an "O" and their opponent must mark the square with an "X". If a player guesses all of the squares containing their opponent's ships, they have sunk all of their opponent's ships and they win the game.

Battleship is a great game for people of all ages. It requires strategy and luck, and it can be a very intense and exciting game. It is easy to learn and can be played in a short amount of time.
