Angina is a condition that causes chest pain or discomfort due to inadequate blood flow to the heart. It is typically caused by coronary artery disease (CAD), which is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Angina is a warning sign that the heart is not getting enough oxygen. It is important to recognize the symptoms of angina and seek medical attention to prevent further damage to the heart.

Angina is classified as either stable or unstable. Stable angina is characterized by chest pain or discomfort that occurs in a predictable pattern, such as when exercising or under emotional stress. Unstable angina is more severe, and the chest pain or discomfort does not follow a predictable pattern. It may occur at rest or with minimal exertion.

The most common symptom of angina is chest pain or discomfort. This may feel like a squeezing, burning, or tightness in the chest. It may also be felt in the arms, neck, jaw, or back. Other symptoms may include nausea, shortness of breath, sweating, fatigue, and lightheadedness.

There is no single test to diagnose angina. A doctor may perform a physical exam, review medical and family history, and order tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, stress test, or coronary angiogram. These tests can help determine the cause of the angina and the best treatment.

Treatment for angina depends on the type and severity of the condition. Stable angina is often managed with lifestyle changes and medication. This may include quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Medications such as nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers may be prescribed to reduce chest pain and improve blood flow to the heart.

Unstable angina is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention. Treatment may include medications to reduce chest pain and improve blood flow to the heart, as well as angioplasty or bypass surgery.

With proper treatment, angina can be managed and the risk of heart attack and other serious complications can be reduced.
