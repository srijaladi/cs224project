Armour was also used by the Greeks and Romans, who used it to protect their soldiers in battle. During the Middle Ages, armour was used by knights to protect them from their enemies in battle, and it was also used by hunters and adventurers to protect them from wild animals.

Armour was typically made from metal, such as iron or steel, and was often decorated with intricate designs and patterns. Armour was also made from leather and other materials, such as chainmail and quilted fabrics. Armour was designed to protect the wearer by deflecting or absorbing blows from weapons, such as swords and arrows. It also provided protection from the elements, such as rain and cold temperatures.
