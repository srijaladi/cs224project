Blackfish is a 2013 documentary film directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, which focuses on the captivity of orcas, or killer whales, and its effects on their physical and psychological health. The film follows the story of Tilikum, an orca captured in 1983 and held in captivity at SeaWorld Orlando. Blackfish is an examination of the consequences of keeping such intelligent and social creatures in captivity, and the tragic consequences that can result.

The film begins by establishing the relationship between orcas and humans in nature. Orcas are highly intelligent and social creatures, capable of forming strong bonds with their families and communities. In the wild, orcas form close-knit family pods and live in large, complex social groups. They are also capable of communicating with each other and demonstrating a wide range of emotions, from joy and playfulness to aggression and fear. 

The film then moves on to discuss the conditions in which orcas are kept in captivity, and the effects this has on their physical and psychological health. In captivity, orcas are deprived of their natural environment and social structure, and forced to live in small, isolated tanks. This can lead to physical and psychological problems, such as aggression, depression, and even self-mutilation. The film highlights the fact that orcas in captivity have a much shorter lifespan than those in the wild, and that their health and behavior can be drastically affected by the conditions in which they are kept.

The film also examines the history of Tilikum, the orca at the center of the story. Tilikum was captured in 1983 and held in captivity at SeaWorld Orlando for over thirty years. During this time, he was involved in the deaths of three people, and the film explores the possible causes of his aggression. The film argues that Tilikum's aggression was caused by the stress and trauma of his captivity and his lack of socialization with other orcas. 

The film concludes by discussing the implications of keeping orcas in captivity and the need for reform. It argues that keeping orcas in captivity is cruel and unnecessary, and that the conditions in which they are kept must be improved if we are to protect their welfare. The film also calls on SeaWorld and other companies to end the practice of keeping orcas in captivity, and to instead focus on protecting and preserving wild orcas.

Blackfish is a powerful and thought-provoking documentary that raises important questions about the consequences of keeping orcas in captivity and the need for reform. It is a must-see for anyone interested in animal welfare and the ethical implications of keeping animals in captivity.
