Antlers are a unique and fascinating feature of the deer family, and have long been a source of fascination to humans. They are found on the heads of male deer and are used for a variety of purposes, including protection, communication, and competition. Antlers are made of bone and are shed and regrown annually. They are unique among mammals in that they are the only animal to shed and regrow their bones.

Antlers are composed of two main parts: the pedicle and the antler itself. The pedicle is a short bony projection from the skull and is the point from which the antler grows. The antler is made of a protein called keratin, which is the same material that makes up human hair and fingernails. Antlers are usually branched, with multiple points, and can range in size from a few inches to several feet long.

Antlers serve a variety of purposes. They are used for protection, as they can be used to ward off other animals or even humans. They are also used for communication, as they are often used to signal dominance or aggression. Antlers are also used for competition, as males use them to compete for mates.

Antlers are primarily made of calcium and phosphorus, and are formed through a process called ossification. This process begins in the spring, when the male deer's body begins to produce new hormones. These hormones cause the pedicle to begin to grow, and the antler begins to form. As the antler grows, it is covered in a velvet-like skin that is rich in nutrients and helps the antler to grow quickly.

The antler growth process is complete by the fall, when the velvet is shed and the antler is fully formed. The antler is then used for protection, communication, and competition. At the end of the year, the antler is shed and the process begins again.

Antlers have long been a source of fascination and admiration for humans. They have been used as decorations, weapons, and even currency. Antlers have also been used in traditional medicine, as they are believed to have healing properties.
