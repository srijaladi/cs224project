Approval is a powerful emotion that can have a lasting effect on a person’s life. It can be defined as the positive recognition, acceptance, and support of someone or something. Approval can be sought from a variety of sources, such as peers, family, teachers, and even strangers. It can be an invaluable source of validation and self-worth, as well as a source of motivation and guidance.

The need for approval is rooted in our basic human need for connection. We are social creatures and crave the presence of others. We want our actions and decisions to be validated by those around us. This need for approval is especially strong during childhood, when we are forming our sense of identity and self-esteem. We often look to our parents and other adults in our lives for approval, as well as our peers. We want to feel accepted and valued by those around us, and this need can stay with us into adulthood.

The desire for approval can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can provide us with the affirmation and motivation we need to grow and thrive. It can give us the confidence to take risks and pursue our dreams. On the other hand, it can be a source of pressure and anxiety. We may feel like we need to constantly prove ourselves to others in order to be accepted and valued. We may also worry that we won’t receive the approval we desire and feel like failures if we don’t meet the standards set by others.

The key to finding a healthy balance between the need for approval and the need for self-validation is to recognize that our self-worth is not dependent on the approval of others. We can learn to trust our own judgment and decisions and recognize that we don’t need to seek the approval of others in order to feel good about ourselves. We can also focus on building meaningful relationships with people who support and validate us, rather than seeking approval from those who may not have our best interests at heart.

Ultimately, approval is an important and necessary part of life. It can be a source of comfort, motivation, and validation. But it is important to remember that our self-worth is not dependent on the approval of others. We can learn to trust our own judgment and decisions, and focus on building relationships with those who truly support and value us.
