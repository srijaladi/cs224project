The Beastie Boys are an American hip-hop group from New York City, formed in 1981. They are one of the most influential and iconic rap groups of all time, and have been credited with helping to bring hip-hop to the mainstream. The group consists of Mike D (Michael Diamond), MCA (Adam Yauch), and Ad-Rock (Adam Horovitz).

The Beastie Boys first gained notoriety for their outrageous antics and wild live shows, which were often filled with profanity and sexual references. They were initially seen as a joke, but their debut album Licensed to Ill (1986) proved the group was serious about their music. The album featured the singles “(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)” and “No Sleep ‘Til Brooklyn,” and was a huge success, selling over nine million copies in the US alone.

The group’s sound changed dramatically with their next two albums, Paul’s Boutique (1989) and Check Your Head (1992). The former featured a more eclectic mix of samples and styles, while the latter was a return to their punk-influenced roots. Both albums were critical and commercial successes, and helped to solidify the Beastie Boys’ status as one of the most important groups in hip-hop.

The Beastie Boys continued to evolve their sound throughout the 1990s, incorporating elements of funk, jazz, and alternative rock into their music. They released the albums Ill Communication (1994), Hello Nasty (1998), and To the 5 Boroughs (2004), all of which were critically acclaimed and commercially successful. The group also released several solo albums and collaborated with other artists, including Nas, Q-Tip, and the Wu-Tang Clan.

The Beastie Boys have been credited with helping to bring hip-hop to the mainstream and have had a huge influence on the genre. They have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, and have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group disbanded in 2012 following the death of Adam Yauch.

The Beastie Boys are one of the most influential and iconic rap groups of all time. They have had a huge impact on the genre, and their music has been praised for its originality and creativity. The Beastie Boys’ influence can still be heard today in the music of many modern hip-hop artists.
