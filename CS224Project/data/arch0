Archimedes of Syracuse (287 BC - 212 BC) is one of the most famous and influential mathematicians of all time. He is known for his many contributions to mathematics, physics, engineering, and astronomy. He is credited with inventing the Archimedes Screw, a device used to pump water, and the law of buoyancy, which states that an object immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. He is also credited with developing the system of integral calculus and the use of infinitesimals.

Archimedes was born in Syracuse, Sicily, in 287 BC. He was the son of an astronomer and mathematician, Phidias. He studied in Alexandria, Egypt, where he learned from the great mathematicians and scientists of the day, including Euclid, Eratosthenes, and Conon. After completing his studies, he returned to Syracuse, where he served as an advisor to the ruler, King Hieron II.

Archimedes is best known for his work in mathematics. He is credited with discovering the principles of the lever, which states that a force applied to a lever arm will cause a proportional change in the distance between the fulcrum and the point of application of the force. He also developed the method of exhaustion, which is a method of finding the area of a circle by inscribing a polygon within it and then calculating the area of the polygon. He also developed the Archimedes' Principle, which states that an object immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

In addition to his mathematical works, Archimedes is also credited with several inventions. He is credited with inventing the Archimedes Screw, a device used to pump water, and the claw of Archimedes, a device used to lift ships out of the water. He also invented the compound pulley, a device used to lift heavy objects, and the odometer, a device used to measure distance.
