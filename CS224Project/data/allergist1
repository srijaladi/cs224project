Allergists are trained in immunology, the study of the immune system, and are experts in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. Allergists use a variety of tests and treatments to help patients manage and control their allergies and asthma.

Allergists are trained to evaluate a patientâ€™s medical history and symptoms to determine the cause of the allergy or asthma. They may use skin tests, blood tests, and other tests to diagnose the condition. Allergists may also use immunotherapy, which involves exposing the patient to small amounts of the allergen, to help the patient build up a tolerance to the allergen.

Allergists may prescribe antihistamines, decongestants, and other medications to reduce symptoms of allergies and asthma. Allergists may also recommend lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding triggers, to reduce the symptoms of allergies and asthma.
