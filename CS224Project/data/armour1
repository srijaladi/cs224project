Armour has been around since ancient times, and has been used by many different cultures for protection in battle. Armour is a type of protective clothing that is designed to absorb or deflect physical attacks, and is usually made from metal, leather, or other materials. Armour can be divided into two main categories: offensive and defensive. Offensive armour is designed to protect the wearer from enemy attacks, while defensive armour is designed to protect the wearer from their own weapons.

The earliest known use of armour dates back to the Bronze Age, when it was used by the Assyrians, Egyptians, and Greeks. Armour was made from leather, wood, and metal and was designed to protect the wearer from arrows and spears. The Romans were the first to use metal armour, which was made from bronze or iron. This type of armour was very effective in protecting the wearer from swords and other weapons.

Throughout history, armour has been used in many different ways. In the Middle Ages, knights wore armour to protect themselves from their enemies. Armour was also used by soldiers in the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II. Today, armour is still used by some military forces, but it is not as common as it once was.

Armour has also been used for ceremonial purposes. In many cultures, armour was worn as a symbol of power and status. For example, in the Middle Ages, knights wore armour to show their rank and wealth. In some cultures, armour was also used to show loyalty to a particular ruler or cause.

Throughout history, armour has evolved significantly. Today, armour is much lighter and more comfortable than it was in the past. Modern armour is made from a variety of materials, including Kevlar, ceramic, and titanium. This type of armour is designed to be lightweight and flexible, while still providing a high level of protection.
