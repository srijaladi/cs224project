A behest is a legal term that refers to a request or command. It is most commonly used in the context of wills and trusts, where it is used to refer to a request or command made by a testator (the person making the will) that the executor (the person in charge of carrying out the instructions in the will) must follow. In some cases, a behest may be made to a third party, such as a charity or other organization, to receive a bequest (a gift of money or property) from the estate of the deceased.

The purpose of a behest is to ensure that the wishes of the testator are carried out in accordance with the law. It is important that the executor follows the instructions of the testator, as failure to do so may result in legal action taken against them. The executor must act in the best interests of the estate and must ensure that the wishes of the testator are followed.

When making a will, it is important that the testator clearly states their wishes and makes them known to the executor. This can be done in a number of ways, including writing down the instructions in the will itself, or providing a separate document that outlines the instructions. It is important that the instructions are clear and unambiguous, as any ambiguity in the instructions may lead to disputes or confusion.

In some cases, a testator may make a behest to a third party, such as a charity or other organization, to receive a bequest from the estate of the deceased. This can be a valuable way for the testator to ensure that their wishes are carried out, even after their death. It is important that the testator clearly states the amount of the bequest and to whom it is to be given, as well as any conditions that may be attached to the bequest.

When making a will, it is important to ensure that all of the instructions are clear and unambiguous. This includes any behests that are made, as failure to follow the instructions may lead to legal action taken against the executor. It is also important to ensure that the instructions are in accordance with the law, as any instructions that are not in accordance with the law may be invalidated.

Overall, a behest is an important legal term that is used to ensure that the wishes of the testator are carried out in accordance with the law. It is important that the testator clearly states their wishes in the will, and that any behests are made in accordance with the law.
