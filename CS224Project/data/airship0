Airships, also known as dirigibles or blimps, are lighter-than-air aircrafts that are propelled by engines and steered by rudders. They are filled with a gas, typically helium, that is lighter than air and buoyant enough to lift the airship off the ground. Airships have been around since the late 19th century, and have been used for a variety of purposes, from military operations to commercial transport.

Airships are typically divided into two categories: non-rigid, or blimps, and rigid. Non-rigid airships, or blimps, are the most common type of airship and have no internal frame. Instead, they rely on the pressure of the gas within the envelope to maintain their shape. Rigid airships, on the other hand, have an internal frame that gives them their shape, and are typically larger than non-rigid airships.

Airships are powered by a variety of engines, including internal combustion engines, electric motors, and even solar panels. The engines are used to turn a propeller, which propels the airship forward. Airships are also steered by rudders, which are located at the back of the airship and can be used to change the direction of the airship.

Airships have been used for a variety of purposes throughout their history. They were initially used for military reconnaissance, but later on, they were used for commercial transport, carrying both passengers and cargo. During World War I, airships were used to transport troops and supplies, and during the 1930s, they were used to transport passengers on transatlantic routes.

Airships are also popular for leisure activities, such as sightseeing tours. They offer a unique experience, as passengers can enjoy the view from the airship's gondola, which is suspended below the envelope.

Despite their many uses, airships have some drawbacks. They are slow and can be difficult to maneuver, and they are also vulnerable to strong winds and turbulence. Additionally, they require a large crew and are expensive to operate.

Despite these drawbacks, airships remain popular today. They are still used for leisure activities, such as sightseeing tours, and are also used for scientific research, as well as for advertising and promotional purposes. Airships may not be as popular as they once were, but they still have a place in the world of aviation.
