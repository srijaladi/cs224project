A bankbook is a record of a customer’s financial transactions with a bank. It is essentially a record of deposits, withdrawals, and other transactions that have taken place with the bank. Bankbooks have been around since the early 19th century and remain an important tool for tracking and managing finances.

The bankbook is typically a small booklet that is issued to each customer by the bank. It contains the customer’s name and account number, as well as a record of all deposits and withdrawals. Each deposit or withdrawal is recorded with the date, amount, and type of transaction. The bankbook also serves as a receipt for the customer, providing proof of the transaction.

The primary purpose of the bankbook is to keep track of a customer’s transactions with the bank. It is an important tool for managing finances, as it allows customers to easily track their account balance and view their recent transactions. It also serves as a source of proof for any transactions, which can be used in case of disputes or to dispute incorrect fees or charges.

Bankbooks are also used to manage savings accounts. Customers can use the bankbook to track their deposits and withdrawals, and also to view their account balance. This allows customers to monitor their savings and decide when to make additional deposits or withdrawals.

Bankbooks are also used to manage investments. Customers can use the bankbook to track their investments and view their performance. This allows them to make informed decisions about their investments and to determine when to buy or sell.
