Over the centuries, banking evolved to include services such as loan issuance, currency exchange, and investment management.

Modern banking services began to emerge in the early 19th century with the advent of the Industrial Revolution. This period saw the development of modern banking services such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and credit cards. Over the last two centuries, banking has become an integral part of the global economy.
