Babe Ruth is one of the most iconic and beloved figures in sports history. He is remembered for his incredible hitting prowess, his larger-than-life personality, and his charitable work. Born George Herman Ruth Jr. on February 6, 1895, in Baltimore, Maryland, he was the first of eight children born to George Sr. and Kate Ruth. His father was a saloon-keeper and his mother a domestic worker. Ruth’s parents were often absent from his life, leaving him in the care of his maternal grandmother.

Ruth’s grandmother taught him to play baseball at an early age, and he quickly developed into a talented player. He was spotted by a professional scout while playing in a sandlot game and signed to his first contract with the Baltimore Orioles in 1914. Ruth was later sold to the Boston Red Sox, where he quickly established himself as one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball.

In 1919, Ruth was sold to the New York Yankees, and his career as a hitter began. Ruth quickly became the most feared hitter in the game, setting numerous records for home runs and runs batted in (RBI). He was the first player to hit 60 home runs in a single season, and his 714 career home runs stood as a record for more than 40 years. Ruth also helped the Yankees win seven American League pennants and four World Series championships.

Off the field, Ruth was a larger-than-life personality. He was famous for his love of food, his gregarious personality, and his charitable work. He helped raise funds for numerous charities, including the American Red Cross and the Babe Ruth Foundation. He also served as an ambassador for the game, traveling around the world to promote baseball.

Ruth’s career ended in 1935, and he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936. He died in 1948, but his legacy lives on. His name is synonymous with baseball greatness, and he is remembered as one of the greatest players in the history of the game.
