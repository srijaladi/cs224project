An atrium is a large open space, usually found in the center of a building, which is typically surrounded by other rooms or hallways. It is often used to provide natural light and ventilation to the interior of the building, while also creating a sense of openness and spaciousness. Atriums can be found in many types of buildings, including homes, offices, hotels, churches, and museums.

Atriums have been used in architecture since ancient times. In ancient Rome, atriums were used as a central gathering place for the entire household. They were also used in public buildings, such as temples, to provide a gathering space for the public.

Atriums can also be used to create a natural environment within a building. For example, an atrium can be used to create a green space, or to provide a place for plants to grow. Atriums can also be used to create a space for outdoor activities, such as a swimming pool or a playground.
