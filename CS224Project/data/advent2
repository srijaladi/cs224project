Advent is a season observed in many Christian churches as a time of expectant waiting and preparation for the celebration of the birth of Jesus at Christmas. The term is a version of the Latin word meaning "coming". The season of Advent is the beginning of the liturgical year for many churches and is often celebrated from the fourth Sunday before Christmas to the day before Christmas.

Advent is a time of preparation for the coming of Jesus. It is a time of spiritual preparation, of repentance and of hope. During Advent, Christians prepare their hearts and minds to receive the Christ child. They also look forward to the coming of the Kingdom of God.

The Advent season is traditionally marked by the lighting of an Advent wreath. The wreath is made of evergreen branches and is decorated with four candles. The four candles represent the four Sundays of Advent. The first candle is lit on the first Sunday of Advent and the fourth candle is lit on Christmas Eve. The lighting of the candles symbolizes the coming of Jesus and the hope of salvation.

Advent is also a time of fasting and penitence. Many churches have special services of prayer and worship during the season of Advent. These services focus on the coming of Jesus and the hope of salvation. They also emphasize the need for repentance and preparation for the coming of Jesus.

Advent is also a time of anticipation and joy. Many churches celebrate the season with special music and decorations. Christmas carols are sung in churches and homes. Christmas trees, lights, and decorations are put up to mark the season. The anticipation of Christmas brings joy to many.
