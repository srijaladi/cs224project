Beanie Babies are a type of plush toy that was popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s. They were produced by Ty Inc., and were created by Ty Warner, who had previously been a designer for the company. The toys were produced in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors, and featured a variety of animals, characters, and other figures. Beanie Babies became popular due to their collectability and their low price, and they quickly became a craze, with people collecting them and trading them with friends.

Beanie Babies were first released in 1993, and the first to be released were the “Original Nine”, which included a bear, a pig, a frog, a dog, a lamb, a turtle, a hippo, a kangaroo, and a dinosaur. These were released in two sizes, a regular size and a miniature size. Over the years, more Beanie Babies were released, including a wide variety of animals, characters, and other figures. In addition to the regular size, there were also Beanie Babies in the larger “Biggie” size, as well as the smaller “Teenie” size.

Beanie Babies quickly became popular, and people began to collect them and trade them with friends. The Beanie Babies were often sold in stores in bags that contained several different Beanie Babies, and these bags could be opened and the Beanie Babies inside could be traded. The Beanie Babies were also often sold in “mystery bags”, which contained a surprise Beanie Baby inside. This added to the collectability of the toys, and people would often buy multiple mystery bags in order to try and get a rare Beanie Baby.

The popularity of Beanie Babies led to a huge secondary market, with people buying and selling the toys for a wide variety of prices. Some Beanie Babies were highly sought after, and could be sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars. This led to some people buying and selling Beanie Babies as an investment, and some people even made a living by buying and selling them.

The popularity of Beanie Babies eventually faded, and by the early 2000s the craze had largely died out. However, the Beanie Babies are still popular with some collectors, and there are still some people who buy and sell them. The Beanie Babies have also had a lasting impact on the toy industry, and the concept of collectability has been used in many other toys that have been released since.
